### Chronological Age and Age Groups
#### Childhood
End of infancy to the start of adolescence. Often divided into early childhood (Preschool - 1-4), middle childhood (elementary school - up to 6th grade)

#### Adolescence
Difficult period to define (wrt chronological age) due to variation in onset and termination. WHO defines as 10-18 but girls: 8-19, boys: 10-22. Starts with accelerated growth rate.
